# Future build out and ideas

Units - ft/lbs vs joules, C vs F temp.

Enums? image types, url types

## Possible new fields and relationships

sample
  Dimensions - how to represent
  wear resistance 
  micrograph images - https://via.placeholder.com/150
    * as array relation, with types (type="micrograph")
  % carbide volume?
  corrosion resistance
  sharpenability / wear resistance
  
Steel
  Composition?
  Tags[]
  Articles, hrefs with rel
 

### Actions

Docker for frontend. https://medium.com/bb-tutorials-and-thoughts/next-js-local-development-with-docker-compose-7b1954292a1f

Need a frontend API?

## Vizualizations

Hardness toughness by selectors for filtering

Trend lines using spline etc

Equations, such as cementite https://knifesteelnerds.com/2018/11/19/steel-edge-retention/

Using guide from https://wattenberger.com/blog/react-and-d3

## Filtering

For various views, how to filter to only the information of interest. Examples:
* Stainless
* High alloy
* Custom group

May want to compare A vs B as groups. Use colors to distinguish a series. 

Suggest tag arrays for steel types
